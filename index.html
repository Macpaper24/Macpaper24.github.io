  <div id="zText">Why I chose this</div>

  <div id="dText"> Before senior project was even announced I already knew that I wanted to do something related to programming. I discovered programming in 7th grade by taking a short two week class on Khan Academy. I thought it was pretty interesting so I bought a few introductory coding books, watched many tutorials, went through some self-teaching coding websites (Codecademy, Codeschool, TheOdinProject) participated in some online college courses on the subject.</div>

    <div id="zText">The REAL Problem:</div>
    <div id="dText">Before I started this project, I thought I knew a lot about programming. When I had the idea to make a multiplayer tetris website, I thought it would be fairly easy for me because I've been learning this kinda stuff for so long. What I really learned is that I suck at programming and I had no idea how to even start my project.</div>
  </div>
  <div id="right">
    <div id="zText">_</div>
    <div id="dText">This senior project really helped me realize just how much of a beginner I still was. I found out that the best way to learn isn't to read books or watch youtube tutorials or go through many online courses. It's like trying to learn how to speak french without ever speaking french. The best way to learn is to start with an idea and try to make it. </div>
